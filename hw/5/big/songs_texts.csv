0,taylor swift,love story taylor's version,"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standin' there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, ""Please don't go, "" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was beggin' you, ""Please don't go, "" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, ""Marry me, Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"
1,taylor swift,anti-hero,"I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis (tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman? (Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from hell""

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi, everybody agrees, everybody agrees

It's me, hi (hi), I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At tea (tea) time (time), everybody agrees (everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero"
2,taylor swift,lover,"We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me homeWe could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules

Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my
Lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my
Lover"
3,taylor swift,blank space,"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ay

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young, and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young, and we're reckless (oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm (oh)
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (insane)
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever

4,taylor swift,bejeweled,"Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walking all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way, I'm going out tonight

Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I can still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice

Nice

Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl (too good of a girl)
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world (huh), have you heard? (Huh)
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you (I miss you)
But I miss sparkling (ah, hey)

Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I can still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice

Nice

Sapphire tears on my face
Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my aura's moonstone
Just 'cause he was high
And we're dancin' all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do?
A diamond's gotta shine

Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer (shimmer)
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I can still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real (nice), I polish up real nice

And we're dancin' all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do? What's a girl gonna do?
I polish up nice
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer"
5,taylor swift,you need to calm down,"You are somebody that I don't know
But you're taking shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like ""Damn, it's 7:00 a.m.""
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""

And I ain't trying to mess with your self-expression
But I've learned the lesson that stressin'
And obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones so

So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)
You need to just stop
Like, can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

You are somebody that we don't know
But you're coming at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad?
When you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Making that sign, must've taken all night

You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay so

So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)
You need to just stop
Like, can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down

And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now, we all got crowns
You need to calm down

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (you need to calm down)
You're being too loud (you're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)
You need to just stop (can you stop?)
Like, can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down"
6,taylor swift,all too wait taylor's version,"I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something about it felt like home somehow
And I, left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now

Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You told me 'bout your past thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah

And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well

And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well"

You could've been gettin' down to this sick beat

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like, ""Oh my God!"" but I'm just gonna shake

You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)

And I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time

He says, ""What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinkin' 'bout you and I""

I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been

You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing

A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be

Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha

I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha (ha-ah, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha

Burning it down
Someday when you leave me

Follow you around

And you don't really read into
My melancholia

I've been under scrutiny (yeah, oh yeah)
You handle it beautifully (yeah, oh yeah)
All this shit is new to me (yeah, oh yeah)

I feel a lavender haze creeping up on me
So real, I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal, the 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

All they keep asking me (all they keep asking me)
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kind of girl they see (the only kind of girl they see)
Is a one night or a wife

I find it dizzying (yeah, oh yeah)
They're bringing up my history (yeah, oh yeah)
But you aren't even listening (yeah, oh yeah)

So real, I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal, the 1950s shit they want from me

Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's coming back around

And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Spider-boy, king of thieves
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice
Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?
It's coming back around

Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here
(I'm still, I'm still here)

'Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karma's gonna track you down
Step by step from town to town
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me

'Cause karma is my boyfriend (karma is my boyfriend)
Karma is a god

14,taylor swift,willow,"I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine
The more that you say
The less I know
Wherever you stray
I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
That's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
The more that you say
The less I know
Wherever you stray
I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
That's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
That's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
But I come back stronger than a 90's trend

Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
Guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait and switch was a work of art

The more that you say
The less I know
Wherever you stray
I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
That's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
That's my man

The more that you say
The less I know
Wherever you stray
I follow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
That's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
That's my man

Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait and switch was a work of art
That's my man

15,katy perry,one of the boys,"I saw a spider, I didn't scream
'Cause, I can belch the alphabet just double dog dare me
And I chose guitar over ballet
And I tape these suckers down, 'cause, they just get in my way

The way you look at me is kinda like a little sister
Rubbed by your goodbyes
And it leaves me nothing but blisters
I saw a spider, I didn't scream

The way you look at me is kinda like a little sister
Rubbed by your goodbyes
And it leaves me nothing but blisters

So I don't wanna be one of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be one of the girls
Pretty in pearls and not one of the boys

So over the summer something changed
I started reading Seventeen and shaving my legs
And I study Lolita religiously
And I walked right into school and caught you staring at me

'Cause, I know what you know
But now you're gonna have to take a number
It's okay
Maybe one day, but not until you give me my diamond ring

'Cause, I don't wanna be one of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be your homecoming queen
Pin-up poster dream and not one of the boys

I wanna be a flower, not a dirty weed
I wanna smell like roses, not a baseball team
And I swear maybe one day
You're gonna wanna make out, make out, make out with me

Don't wanna be
Don't wanna be
Don't wanna be

'Cause, I don't wanna be one of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be one of the girls

Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it"

You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter
Like a hard candy with a surprise center
How do I get better once I've had the best
You said, there's tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test

I keep knockin' on wood

I wish I could just turn you on
Put a battery in, make you talk
Even pull a string, for you to say anything
But with you there is no guarantee
Only expired warranty
A bunch of broken parts
And I can't seem to find your heart

Oh, I'm such a fool
I'm such a fool
I'm such a fool
This one's outta my hands
I can't put you back together again

That my love is real but you're not a man
You're just a, a toy
Could you ever be a real, real boy and understand?
But you're not a man

If the past is the problem
Our future could solve 'em, baby
I could bring you to life
If you let me inside, baby
It'll hurt, but in the end
You'll be a man

You're not a man

A toy, could you ever be a real, real boy?

Feeling so high but looking so low
Party favors on the floor
Group of girls banging on the door
So many new fair-weather friends

Known the way and still so lost

Caught in the eye of a hurricane
Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
So sick of this town pulling me down, oh
My mother says I should come back home
But can't find the way 'cause the way is gone
So if I pray am I just sending words into outer space

Have you ever been so lost
Known the way and still so lost

Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost

Is there a light, is there a light
At the end of the road
I'm pushing everyone away
'Cause I can't feel this anymore
Can't feel this anymore
Have you ever been so lost
Know the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost
Have you ever been so lost"

Into the crowd
And I got a bloody knee
Under my skin
A mark from wiping out

I can't stop
Don't care if I lose
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted too

With each scar there's a map
That tells a story
What a souvenir of Young
Love's like jumping out
An airplane riding a tidal
Wave on an ocean of emotion
My heart rips me wide open

I can't stop
Don't care if I lose
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted too

And I cover up these scars
(We'll make it we'll make it
But we break it)
And I can't stop seeing stars
(Lets hope not die)
Whenever you're around
Around

I can't stop
Don't care if I lose
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you

And I'll be giving my two weeks

Pick your favorite shade of black

Say something funny
Say something sweet
But don't say that you loved me

'Cause I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for awhile
This sickness has no cure
We're goin' down for sure
Already lost a grip
Best abandon ship

Maybe I was too pale
Maybe I was too fat
Maybe you wanted better, better luck in the sack
No formal education
I swear way too much
I swear you didn't care
'Cause we were in love

So as I write this letter and shed my last tear
No, it's all for the better
That we end this here
Let's close this chapter
Say one last prayer
But don't say that you loved me

But we've been dead for awhile
This sickness has no cure
We're goin' down for sure

Every day, Groundhog Day

I guess you're out of your mind 'til it actually happens

I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?

They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house

'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
Hey, hey
Oh, cover me in daisies
Hey, hey

When did we all stop believing in magic?
Why did we put all our hopes in a box in the attic?

I'm the long shot
I'm the Hail Mary
Why can't it be me?

They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house

29,katy perry,never really over,"I'm losing my self control
Yeah, you're starting to trickle back in

I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, ""Draw the line""
And I do, I do
But once in a while I trip up, and I cross the line
And I think of you

Two years, and just like that, my head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess, but wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I guess it's never really over

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

I guess I could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain
'Cause I can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name

I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, ""Draw the line""

Thought we kissed goodbye, thought we meant this time
Was the last, but I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back, I guess it's never really over

I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul

and I can hear a bell ring
(One more look) and I forget everything, whoa

Mamma mia, here I go again
My, my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My, my, just how much I've missed you?

Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My, my, I could never let you go

I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong

and I can hear a bell ring

Mamma mia, here I go again

Mamma mia, does it show again
My, my, just how much I've missed you?

Bye-bye, leave me now or never

Bye-bye doesn't mean forever

You can dance
You can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl
Watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music
Getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music
Everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet
Only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance
You can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl
Watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another
Anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet
Only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance

33,abba,i still have faith in you,"I still have faith in you
I see it now
Through all these years that faith lives on
Somehow

There was a union
Of heart and mind
The likes of which are rare
And, oh, so hard to find

Do I have it in me?
I believe it is in there
For I know I hear a bittersweet song
In the memories we share

I still have faith in you
And I will say
I never really thought I'd feel this way

But I remind myself
Of who we are
How inconceivable it is to reach this far

Do I have it in me?
I believe it is in there
For I know I hear a bittersweet song
In the memories we share

We do have it in us
New spirit has arrived
The joy and the sorrow
We have a story and it survived

And we need one another
Like fighters in a ring
We're in this together
Passion and courage is everything

I still have faith in you
It stands above
The crazy things we did
It all comes down to love

Do I have it in me?
I believe it is in there
For I know I hear a bittersweet song
In the memories we share
Do I have it in me?

We do have it in us
New spirit has arrived
The joy and the sorrow
We have a story and it survived

And we know that we need one another
Like fighters in a ring
We're in this together
Passion and courage is everything

and we still have it in us
We've only just begun
(Do I have it in me?)
We stand on a summit
Humble and grateful to have survived

I still have faith in you
It's stands above the crazy things we did
It all comes down to love
Do I have it in me?"
34,abba,when you danced with me,"I can remember when you left Kilkenny
And you told me, ""I'll return next year""
I never meant to hold you to your promise
And the years went by and I'm still here
So you left for the city, I hope you like it there
You're only here now to see the Village Fair
You're just here for the music, that's all, or could it be
You miss the good old times when you danced with me

So is the outside world as you imagined?
Was it worth it, severing the ties?
Happy to see me or a bit embarrassed?
There's a darkness deep in your blue eyes
So you left for the city, I hope you like it there
You're only here now to see the Village Fair
You're just here for the music, that's all, or could it be
You miss the good old times when you danced with me

When you danced with me

I miss the good old times when you danced with me"
35,abba,little things,"Little things
Like my gentle touch
It's amazing, darling
That so little can achieve so much

Little things
Like your sleepy smile
As the brand new day is dawning
It's a lovely Christmas morning

And why don't we stay in bed for a while
Soon enough, they'll be waking up from their dreams
Children bursting with giggles and screams
Oh, what joy Santa brings
Thanks, old friend, for packing
Christmas stockings full of nice little things

Little things
Like your naughty eyes
You'd consider bringing me a breakfast tray
But there's a price

Little things
Like that happy noise
As a brand new day is dawning
On this lovely Christmas morning

It's our children playing with their new toys
Little moments of happiness and of bliss
Does it ever get better than this?
Oh, what joy Santa brings
Thanks, old friend, for packing
Christmas stockings full of nice little things

Thank you, dear old friend, for packing
Christmas stockings full of nice little things

Little things
Like the precious jewels on rings
Or a music box that will fit in socks
Tiny elves with wings
Not as big as queens and their kings
If you sing along, it could be a song
That my grandma sings"
36,abba,take a chance on me,"I've seen you twice, in a short time
Only a week since we started
It seems to me, for every time
I'm getting more open-hearted

I was an impossible case
No-one ever could reach me
But I think I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
So I wanna know

What's the name of the game?
Does it mean anything to you?
What's the name of the game?
Can you feel it the way I do?
Tell me please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow

And you make me talk
And you make me feel
And you make me show
What I'm trying to conceal
If I trust in you, would you let me down?
Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?
Could you feel the same way too?
I wanna know

The name of the game

I have no friends, no-one to see
And I am never invited
Now I am here, talking to you
No wonder I get excited

Your smile, and the sound of your voice
And the way you see through me
Got a feeling, you give me no choice
But it means a lot to me
So I wanna know

What's the name of the game? (Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Does it mean anything to you? (Got a feeling you give me no choice)
(But it means a lot)

If I trust in you, would you let me down?
Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?
Could you feel the same way too?
I wanna know
Oh, yes, I wanna know

The name of the game (I was an impossible case)
Does it mean anything to you? (But I think I can see in your face)
(That it means a lot)
What's the name of the game? (Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Can you feel it the way I do? (Got a feeling you give me no choice)

37,abba,just a notion,"Just a notion, that's all
Just a funny feeling deep inside
That you're out there waiting
You're not sure I'm alone
And you wonder if I'm occupied (ah-ha-ha)
So you're hesitating

Just a notion
That you'll be walkin' up to me
In a while and you'll smile and say hello
And we'll be dancin' through the night
Knowin' everything from there on must be right

Just a notion
But somehow I know I'm not wrong
There's somethin' happening that I just can't explain
If I try it's all in vain because it's
Just a notion, that's all
Just a feeling that you're watching me (ah-ha-ha)
Every move I'm makin'

Am I readin' your mind?
'Cause it's almost like you're touching me (ah-ha-ha)
There is no mistaking

Just a notion
That you'll be walkin' up to me
In a while and you'll smile and say hello
And we'll be dancin' through the night
Knowin' everything from there on must be right

Just a notion
But somehow I know I'm not wrong
It is our destiny, there's nothing we can do
And tonight is very special
It's a night for me and you

I, I think it's more than a notion (ah-ha-ha)
Give me more than you're dreaming, step up to the truth"
38,abba,i can be that woman,"You're asleep on the couch with Tammy
And she looks straight up at me
The reproach in her eyes is imagined
But the pain that I feel is real
She jumps down and her tail is swishing
Like a feather right under your nose
And then you wake up and you're bleary-eyed
I say I'm sorry, I can see you've cried

You look frail as you stand before me
Then you curse and kick a chair
And the dog, bless her heart, licks my fingers
But she jerks every time you swear
I feel sick and my hands are shaking
This is how all our fights have begun
You say you've had it
And you say, ""screw you""
I say, ""I love you""
And I know it's true

You're not the man you should have been
I let you down somehow (not the one I could have been)
I'm not the woman I could have been (I can be that woman)
But I can be that woman now

You're confused when you turn to face me
Is it true or is she drunk?
But it's clear that I've hit my rock bottom
I'm aware of how far I've sunk
And the dog is the first to feel it
There's a shimmer of hope in your eyes
You can't believe it
But you're close to tears
Oh God, I'm sorry for the wasted years

You're not the man you should have been (I let you down)
I let you down somehow (not the one I could have been)
I'm not the woman I could have been (I can be that woman now)
But I can be that woman now"
39,abba,the winner take it all,"I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history

I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence

Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules

The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear

The winner takes it all (takes it all)
The loser has to fall (has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (it's so plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain?)

But tell me, does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?

Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say?
Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide (will decide)
The likes of me abide (me abide)
Spectators of the show (of the show)
Always staying low (staying low)

The game is on again (on again)
A lover or a friend (or a friend)
A big thing or a small (big or small)
The winner takes it all (takes it all)

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand

I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence
But you see

The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

So the winner takes it all
And the loser has to fall
Throw the dice, cold as ice
Way down here, someone dear
Takes it all, has to fall
And it's plain, why complain?"

I'm fired up, don't shut me down

Will you leave me standing in the hall or let me enter?
The apartment hasn't changed at all

44,abba,slipping through my fingers,"Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that well-known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while

The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake, I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny

What happened to the wonderful adventures
The places I had planned for us to go?
(Slipping through my fingers all the time)
Well, some of that we did but most we didn't
And why? I just don't know

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time
Slipping through my fingers

Slipping through my fingers all the time

Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile"

You smile at me and say, ""It's time to go""
But I don't feel like goin' home

You said grass was a dirty drug
You like to preach with a vodka in your mug
I love all the things you know
But I'm king on a fifty-metre road
We stand up tall and beat our chests
We shout some things that we'll regret
Sit down with a master plan

I know nobody understands
Me like you do

It's times like these
We're so much happier
Nights like these
We'll remember those stupid jokes
Only we know
You know, when I'm with you
I'm so much happier
Nights like these
We'll remember those songs we wrote
Only we know
You smile at me and say, ""It's time to go""
But I don't feel like goin' home

You and me until the end
Wakin' up to start again
You and me until the end
Wakin' up to start again
There's nowhere else that I would rather be

Because it's times like these
We're so much happier
Nights like these
We'll remember those stupid jokes
Only we know
You know, when I'm with you
I'm so much happier
Nights like these
We'll remember those songs we wrote
Only we know
You smile at me and say, ""It's time to go""
But I don't feel like goin' home"

It's written all over your face, say it
A hurricane behind the door, oh, oh
So I've come ready for a war, oh, oh

You don't want coffee in the morning
I know I'm in a hole
It's hard enough to get you sober
I got no chance if I'm hung over
I ain't even woken up yet
Not nearly vertical
All I know is I'm in trouble
'Cause the atmosphere's so cold, so

Hey, babe
It's written all over your face, say it
A hurricane behind the door, oh, oh
So I've come ready for a war, oh, oh

I hear that thunder in the distance
I know it's getting close
You're giving me the silent treatment
Don't know what it's achieving
When we're finished saying nothing
Can we please get back to lovin'?
When it's good, it's really something
Can we please get back to us now?

Hey, babe
It's written all over your face, say it
A hurricane behind the door, oh, oh
So I've come ready for a war, oh, oh
Hey, babe
It's written all over your face, say it

I'll be ready to talk

64,louis tomlinson,back to you,"I know you say you know me, know me well
But these days I don't even know myself, no
I always thought I'd be with someone else
I thought I would own the way I felt, yeah

I call you but you never even answer
I tell myself I'm done with wicked games
But then I get so numb with all the laughter
That I forget about the pain

Whoa, you stress me out, you kill me
You drag me down, you fuck me up
We're on the ground, we're screaming
I don't know how to make it stop
I love it, I hate it, and I can't take it
But I keep on coming back to you

I know my friends they give me bad advice
Like move on, get you out my mind
But don't you think I haven't even tried?
You got me cornered and my hands are tied

You got me so addicted to the drama
I tell myself I'm done with wicked games
But then I get so numb with all the laughter
That I forget about the pain

Whoa, you stress me out, you kill me
You drag me down, you fuck me up
We're on the ground, we're screaming

Oh, no, no, I just keep on coming back to you (back to you)
Oh, no, no, I just keep on coming back to you

And I guess you'll never know
All the bullshit that you put me through
And I guess you'll never know, no

Yeah, so you can cut me up and kiss me harder
You can be the pill to ease the pain
'Cause I know I'm addicted to your drama
Baby, here we go again

Whoa, you stress me out, you kill me
You drag me down, you fuck me up
We're on the ground, we're screaming
I don't know how to make it stop

66,louis tomlinson,miss you,"Is it my imagination?
Is it something that I'm taking?
All the smiles that I'm faking
""Everything is great
Everything is fucking great""
Going out every weekend
Staring at the stars on the ceiling
Hollywood friends, gotta see them
Such a good time
I believe it this time

Tuesday night
Glazed over eyes
Just one more pint or five
Does it even matter anyway?

We're dancing on tables
And I'm off my face
With all of my people
And it couldn't get better they say
We're singing 'til last call
And it's all out of tune
Should be laughing, but there's something wrong
And it hits me when the lights go on
Shit, maybe I miss you

Just like that and I'm sober
I'm asking myself, ""Is it over?""
Maybe I was lying when I told you
""Everything is great
Everything is fucking great""
And all of these thoughts and the feelings
Cheers to that if you don't need them
I've been checking my phone all evening
Such a good time
I believe it this time

Tuesday night
Glazed over eyes
Just one more pint or five
Does it even matter anyway?

We're dancing on tables

We're singing 'til last call
And it's all out of tune
Should be laughing, but there's something wrong
And it hits me when the lights go on
Shit, maybe I miss you (yeah)

Now I'm asking my friends how to say, ""I'm sorry""
They say, ""Lad, give it time, there's no need to worry""
And we can't even be on the phone now
And I can't even be with you alone now
Oh, how shit changes
We were in love, now we're strangers
When I feel it coming up, I just throw it all away
Get another two shots 'cause it doesn't matter anyway

We're dancing on tables
And I'm off my face
With all of my people
And it couldn't get better they say
We're singing 'til last call
And it's all out of tune
Should be laughing, but there's something wrong
And it hits me when the lights go on

Just tell yourself you've got another day
You've lived that life, you just don't see it yet
I see how hard you've worked to be yourself

If you believe that guy is Superman
They're selling tickets at the cinema
Whatever gets you through the darkest night
Just find the light
Out in the madness, hold tight

'Cause I'm a hard man to lose
But I figured it out then made my way back
To a life I would choose
We were lucky once, I could be lucky again

Before the world had got so serious
Before the time it got away from us
I meet you at the favorite subway stop
We grab some food then meet the lads for one

If you believe that guy is Superman
They're selling tickets at the cinema
Whatever gets you through the darkest night
Just find the light
Out in the madness, hold tight

'Cause I'm a hard man to lose
But I figured it out then made my way back
To a life I would choose
We were lucky once, could be lucky again

I'm a hard man to find
But you figured it out and I love you for that
Look back on a time
I was lucky once, I could be lucky again

'Cause I'm a hard man to lose

The cash, and the cars and the glory
No sleep and we party 'til morning
'Cause nobody cares when you're boring

I'm just like you
Even though my problems look nothing like yours do
Yeah, I get sad too
And when I'm down I need somebody to talk to
Yeah, I feel the same as you do
Same stress, same shit to go through
I'm just like you
If you only knew

If I had it my way, pub lunch every Sunday
Cheap beer and it's okay
I wanna lay where she lays
I wanna stay in these days
Gonna smoke and it's okay

But you only get half of the story
The cash, and the cars and the glory
Just like everyone else here before me
'Cause nobody cares when you're boring

I'm just like you
Even though my problems look nothing like yours do
Yeah, I get sad too
And when I'm down I need somebody to talk to

Is he still getting out of fights?
I'm sorry that your mum don't like me
I'm sorry that I brought that on myself

They say bitter ends turn sweet in time
Is that true of yours and mine?

'Cause if you're lonely in Chicago
You can call me baby
Has it been long enough that you can forgive me?
Just because it didn't work
Doesn't mean it's meaningless to me
It just wasn't meant to be

Have you seen how my life's been going?
'Cause I've been wondering what you'd say
Would you have told me to keep going
Or would you say to walk away?
You always made me feel much better
And I'll always be grateful for that

They say bitter ends turn sweet in time
If that's true for yours and mine

And you feel lonely in Chicago
You can call me baby
Has it been long enough that you can forgive me?
Just because it didn't work
Doesn't mean it's meaningless to me

I didn't have to search 'cause I still know your number
I bet that you didn't think that I'd remember
Just because it didn't work
Doesn't mean it's meaningless to me
It just wasn't meant to be

It just wasn't meant to be
No, it just wasn't meant to be

You can call me baby
Has it been long enough that you can forgive me?

72,louis tomlinson,habit,"I always said that I'd mess up eventually
I told you that, so what did you expect from me?
It shouldn't come as no surprise anymore
I know you said that you'd give me another chance
But you and I knew the truth of it in advance
That mentally you were already out the door

Never thought that giving up would be so hard
God, I'm missing you and your addictive heart

You're the habit that I can't break
You're the feeling I can't put down
You're the shiver that I can't shake
You're the habit that I can't break
You're the high that I need right now
You're the habit that I can't break

I took some time 'cause I've ran out of energy
Of playing someone I heard I'm supposed to be
But honestly, I don't have to choose anymore
And it's been ages, different stages
Come so far from Princess Park
I'll always need ya
In front of me, in front of me

You're the habit that I can't break
You're the feeling I can't put down
You're the shiver that I can't shake
You're the habit that I can't break
You're the high that I need right now
You're the habit that I can't break

You gave me the time and the space
I was out of control and I'm sorry, I let you down
Guess that I know what I already knew
I was better with you, and I miss you now

You're the habit that I can't break

Just to hear the answer phone
Yeah, I know that you won't get this
But I'll leave a message so I'm not alone

This morning I woke up still dreaming
With memories playing through my head
You'll never know how much I miss you
The day that they took you
I wish it was me instead

But you once told me ""Don't give up
You can do it day by day""
And diamonds, they don't turn to dust or fade away

So I will keep you, day and night
Here until the day I die
I'll be living one life for the two of us
I will be the best of me
Always keep you next to me
I'll be living one life for the two of us
Even when I'm on my own
I know I won't be alone
Tattooed on my heart are the words of your favourite song
I know you'll be looking down
Swear I'm gonna make you proud
I'll be living one life for the two of us

I could feel your blood run through me
You're written in my DNA
Looking back in every mirror
I know you'll be waiting
I'll see you again

But you once told me ""Don't give up
You can do it day by day""
And diamonds, they don't turn to dust or fade away (Fade away)

I promised you I'd do this
So all of this is all for you
Oh, I swear to God, you're living
Through everything I'll ever do

So I will keep you, day and night
Here until the day I die
I'll be living one life for the two of us
I will be the best of me
Always keep you next to me
I'll be living one life for the two of us

One life for the two of us

I'll be living one life for the two of us

When you give so much, but it's not enough
When the high's too high, and the low's too low
When you love someone and they let you go

Time takes time to heal it

75,ashe,moral of the story,"So I never really knew you
God, I really tried to
Blindsided, addicted
Felt we could really do this
But really I was foolish
Hindsight, it's obvious

Talking with my lawyer
She said, ""Where'd you find this guy?""
I said, ""Young people fall in love
With the wrong people sometimes""

Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end, it's better for me
That's the moral of the story, babe

It's funny how a memory
Turns into a bad dream
When running wild turns volatile
Remember how we painted our house
Just like my grandparents did?
So romantic, but we fought the whole time
Should have seen the signs, yeah

Talking with my mother
She said, ""Where'd you find this guy?""
Said, ""Some people fall in love
With the wrong people sometimes""

Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end it's better for me
That's the moral of the story, babe

They say it's better to have loved and lost
Than never to have loved at all
That could be a load of shit
But I just need to tell you all

Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just engaged
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end it's better for me
That's the moral of this story

Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love

But you don't stand a chance when you're young, and in love
Right out of the gate, don't it all seem great?
Tried to tell my mother that it felt like fate, but she brushed
It all off and she laughed 'cause we're young, and in love

Ooh, and I hate that she was right
Didn't wanna say goodbye
You loved me, I loved you too
Ooh, maybe in another life
'Cause this one wasn't right
You loved me, I loved you too, soon

Maybe we could meet when we're thirty-three
It's hard to keep a love you meet at fifteen
Thought my best friend was wrong when she said
""You're just young, not in love""

Ooh, and I hate that she was right
Didn't wanna say goodbye
You loved me, I loved you too
(You loved me, I loved you)
Ooh, maybe in another life
'Cause this one wasn't right
You loved me, I loved you too
(You loved me) soon"

Oh, babe, you're the best mistake I made
I'm not mad anymore about the madness, screamin'
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh
I'm not mad anymore about the madness
We didn't have anymore of the magic

Went down like the Sun
But I still hope the best is yet to come
So forget all that angry shit I said
That time on the road trip, I was being controlling
So you got out the car while it was still rolling

Well, that's life, no one makes it out alive
Oh, no, not even Jesus Christ
So even if it makes you cry, ooh

Oh, babe, for the first time, yesterday
I wasn't mad anymore about the madness, screamin'
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Right now, I'm sorry

So, maybe when I'm older
Maybe when I'm older

I'll know what it's like not to love you anymore

Maybe when I'm, maybe when I'm na-na-na-na-na
Maybe when I'm, maybe when I'm, maybe when I'm older

Playing house, immature, picking out furniture
Praying that our hearts would play fair
Emotional souvenirs, fleeting moments, golden years
Close my eyes and I go back there

Right now, I'm sorry

84,ashe,love is not enough,"I'm not tryna break the silence
Baby, I'm just tryin' to fix it
I been tryin' to show you the difference
You can slam the door, tell me that I'm like my mother
You don't need to tell me you're sorry
We don't need to talk 'til you're ready

It takes a lot more than a rose
More than a kiss, more than a hug

'Cause love is not enough
But at least we've got that much
Baby, lay your head down
You can sleep at my house
Whoa-oh, 'cause love is not enough
But at least I've got your touch
The middle of a long night
We don't need it all right now, no

I'm not fragile as you think
Seems like you've been walkin' on eggshells
Didn't put them there when we first fell in love
When early days have faded, everything gets complicated
You said you want a girl with a future
But everybody comes with a price

It takes a lot more than a ring
More than a vow, more than a promise

Love is not enough
But at least we've got that much
Baby, lay your head down
You can sleep at my house
Whoa-oh, 'cause love is not enough
But at least I've got your touch
The middle of a long night
We don't need it all right now, no

Love is not enough
But it's all we're dreamin', oh
You can lay your head down
You can sleep at my house

Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mmm

Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue? (My avenue)
When you (when you) said you were passing through
Was I even on your way?

I knew when I asked you to (when I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was telling you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (what you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid

Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable
So if you really wanna know

When I'm away from you (when I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true (wish it wasn't true), mmm-mmm

You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Driving home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wasting my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fucking friends

I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fucking sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad

I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends
So I shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fucking leave me alone"
86,billie eilish,everything i wanted,"I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm being honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care

Thought I could fly (fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say
""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
It could've been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there

And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say
""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?"

Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh

I'm the bad guy

I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy

Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh

I'm only good at being bad, bad

I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone

88,billie eilish,getting older,"I'm getting older, I think I'm aging well
I wish someone had told me I'd be doing this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waiting at your door
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
Than anyone before (anyone before)
Too bad they're usually deranged

Last week, I realized I crave pity
When I retell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest, I was still being ignored
(Lying for attention just to get neglection)
Now we're estranged

Things I once enjoyed (ah-ah)
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't

I'm getting older, I've got more on my shoulders
But I'm getting better at admitting when I'm wrong
I'm happier than ever, at least that's my endeavor
To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
'Cause to be honest, I just wish that what I promise
Would depend on what I'm given (not on his permission)
(Wasn't my decision) to be abused, mmm

Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for, mmh
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't

But next week, I hope I'm somewhere laughing
For anybody asking, I promise I'll be fine
I've had some trauma, did things I didn't wanna
Was too afraid to tell ya, but now, I think it's time"

But all you do is look the other way, hmm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay"
99,billie eilish,listen before i go,"Take me to the rooftop
I wanna see the world when I stop breathing
Turning blue
Tell me, love is endless, don't be so pretentious
Leave me, like you do (like you do)

If you need me
Wanna see me
Better hurry
'Cause I'm leaving soon

Sorry, can't save me now
Sorry, I don't know how
Sorry, there's no way out (sorry)
But down, mm down

Taste me, the salty tears on my cheek
That's what a year-long headache does to you
I'm not okay, I feel so scattered
Don't say I'm all that matters
Leave me
Deja vu

If you need me
Wanna see me
You better hurry
I'm leaving soon

Sorry, can't save me now
Sorry, I don't know how (sorry)
Sorry, there's no way out (sorry)
But down, mm down

Call my friends and tell
Them that I love them
And I'll miss them
But I'm not sorry
Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
Sorry"

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I been holdin' on too tight
With nothin' in between

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open, but it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning, I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burnin' bright
The way that I've been holdin' on so tight

You've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth

We're broken, we're broken

It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart

We'll leave each other cold as ice
And high and dry, the desert wind
Is blowing, is blowing
Remember what you said to me?
We were drunk in love in Tennessee
And I hold it, we both know it

I just wanna be yours

Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours

I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours

Let me be your 'leccy meter
And I'll never run out
Let me be the portable heater
That you'll get cold without
I wanna be your setting lotion
Hold your hair in deep devotion (I'll be)
At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean
Now I wanna be yours

Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours

In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side
With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
When you look at me like that, my darlin', what did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

Not shy of a spark
The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side
With your hands between your thighs

But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive

But I missed the train
And then the traffic was a state

That reoccurs, oh, when you say I don't care
But, of course I do, yeah, I clearly do

So laugh and joke around?

It's been a thrill

But now, the orchestra's got us all surrounded
And I cannot for the life of me remember how they go

We had 'em out of their seats
Wavin' their arms and stompin' their feet

There's just enough time left to swing by
And re-address the start
If you call and have them pull around the car
And stop specializing in stories from the road

Hello you, still draggin' out a long goodbye?
I ought to apologize for one of the last times

As that meandering chapter reaches its end
And leaves us in a thoughtful little daze
This electric warrior's motorcade
Shall burn no more rubber down that boulevard
Read the message I left on the thank you card
Overtaking the tractor
Waitin' for sets of winds and bends to level out again
Pickin' your moment along a country lane
The kind where the harmonies feel right at home

Hello you, still draggin' out a long goodbye?
I ought to apologize for one of the last times

Takin' a dive into your crystal ball
I've snorkeled on the beaches fruitlessly
Why not rewind to Rawborough Snooker Club?

But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing gets better

'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time, the last time

Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

Oh, oh, no
Let it burn
Oh, oh
Let it burn
Let it burn"

Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart

To the beat (rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door (whoa)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (whoa)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (whoa)
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown

We could've had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)

Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)

This ain't lust
I know this is love, but

If I tell the world
I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do
If I end up with you

Should I give up?
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even If I knew my place, should I leave it there?
Should I give up?
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere

I build myself up
And fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side (other side)

Yeah uh huh I'm drinkin' hot tea b****, feel me

Yeah now if you let me
You wont regret me
S*** if you let me
You wont forget me,
Remember, and if you don't then mind the,
Hold up bah bah! There's a reminder
I ain't kind hot I'm sauna
I sweat money and the bank is my shower
Ha ha and that pistol is my towel
Ha so stop sweatin' me coward
And I would
Die for ours ride
For ours
Supply the flowers
This is history in the making
Now shut the f*** up and let me make it

Please don't shoot me down cause I'm flyin' I'm flyin'
I'm high-up
Please don't me down cause I'm flyin' I'm high up
(This tea is at a real good temperature right now, so am I)

I spit Alcatraz bars I know
And d-boys is the only alphabet boys I know
Gotta 3-80 on my waist and Rambo at home
No more bandanna round my dome bandanna in my right pocket
B**** I'm grown f*** what you on
Now watch me stand on the world as I sit in a throne
And if I jump I'm a fly and look into the eagles eye
And see I am nothin' like you, why?
B**** see, it gets me how nothing gets me or get to me
And if you shootin' for the star than just shoot me
But your bullets don't reach mars
Pause, clause, because I'm a a beast I'm a dog ill get'cha
My picture should be in the dictionary
Next to the definition of definition
Because repetition is the father of learnin'
And son I know your barrel burnin' but

Please don't shoot me down cause I'm flyin' I'm flyin'
I'm high-up
Please don't me down cause I'm flyin' I'm high up
(This tea is at a real good temperature right now, so am I)

Pappa I did it to em, I'm a bastard

These n****s backwards but they behind us
Now watch me get high like times up
Now D bring the drums back
And watch me hit em' where there lungs sat like that
I get respect cause if I don't I'm a take it
I see your boys hatin' and I see your girls naked
Drum sound like a naked gun switch clips with my thumb
Then I pop another clip in and aim at his vision
Cause Wayne is his vision cause Wayne is the mission
I'm aimin' at a mirror

Please don't shoot me down cause I'm flyin' im flyin'
(And I've done it before, please don't make me do it no more)
I'm high-up
Please don't me down cause I'm flyin' I'm high up

166,lil wayne,tie my hand,"We are at war
With the universe
The sky is falling
And the only thing that can save us now
Is sensitivity and compassion
But I know one thing's for sure
I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down

Yeah, some say tragedy is hard to get over
But some time that tragedy means its over, soldier
From the academy league of rollers
I deny being down though they seem to hold us
My shoulders are strong, I prove them wrong
I ain't doing nothing but moving on, let the truth be known
But they talk that freedom at us and didn't even leave a ladder, damn

I work at the corner store
We all got problems problems
No one's gon' fight alone
No one's gon' save us now
How you feel? you're not alone
We're all just jealous, jealous
We don't reach the sky no more
We just can't overcome no

You tie my hands
What am I gonna be
What have I done so bad
What is my destiny
You tie my hands
What am I supposed to see
What have I done so bad
What am I gonna be

I, knock on the door, hope isn't home
Fates not around, the lucks all gone
Don't ask me whats wrong, ask me whats right
And I'mma tell you what's life?
And did you know?
I lost everything, but I ain't the only one
First came the hurricane, then the morning sun
Excuse me if I'm on one, and don't trip if I light one, I walk a tight one
They try to tell me keep my eyes open
My whole city under water, some people still floating
And they wonder why black people still voting,
Cause your president's still choking
Take away the Football team, the Basketball team
Now all we got is me to represent New Orleans, shit
No governor, no help from the mayor
Just a steady beating heart, and a wish and a prayer
Lets pray

These friends they come and go
But I got family family
These kids so fast they grow
They learn so quickly now
But there's no where to go,
But there's future future
Don't make this seem so low
And we can't overcome

You tie my hands
What am I gonna be
What have I done so bad
What is my destiny
You tie my hands
What am I supposed to see
What have I done so bad
What am I gonna be

And if you come from under that water then there's fresh air
Just breathe baby, Gods got a blessing to spare
Yes, I know the process has so much stress
But its the progress that feels the best
Cause I came from the projects straight to success
And your next, so try they cant steal your pride its inside
Then find it and keep on grinding
Cause in every dark cloud there's a silver lining
I know...
Yeah, yeah... yeah
See... right now we just riding on love
And shine in the dark, we ain't tryna do nothing be at the heart
We need love, that's all now

You tie my hands
What am I gonna be
What have I done so bad
What is my destiny
You tie my hands
What am I supposed to see
What have I done so bad
What am I gonna be
You tie my hands
What am I gonna be
What have I done so bad
What is my destiny
You tie my hands
What am I supposed to see
What have I done so bad
What am I gonna be

Born right here in the USA
But due to tragedy, looked on by the whole world as a refugee
So, accept my emotion, do not take it as an offensive gesture
It's just the epitome of my soul
And I must be me
We got spirit y'all
We go spirit
We got soul y'all
We got soul
They don't want us to see, but we already know"
