I'm on it, ooh, I'm on it
I'm so on it, and however you want it
You can get it tonight ho, and all night ho
I get the beat from (Maestro), fuckin' right ho

I might go crazy on these niggas, I don't give a motherfuck
Run up in a nigga house and shoot his grandmother up
What! What! I don't give a motherfuck
Getcha baby kidnapped and ya baby-mother fucked
It's Tha Carter III, bitch, better put your supper up
Hollygrove I throw it up like I'm trying to lose my gut
Fuck is up? Beat him up like a million uppercuts
Got a million duffled up for the fuck of it, shit
Get on my level? You can't get on my level
You would need a space shuttle or a ladder that's forever
However, I'm better, if not now then never
Don't you ever fix your lips unless you 'bout to suck my dick, bitch!
Swallow my words, taste my thoughts
And if it's too nasty, spit it back at me
Two more inches, I'd have been in that casket
According to the doctor, I could have died in traffic
Bounce right back on them bitches like Magic
Abracadabra, I'm up like Viagra
I just do this shit for my clique like Adam Sandler
I control hip-hop and I'ma keep it on my channel

Watch me, bitch, watch me
Bitch watch me! But they cannot see me
Like Hitler, it's the New Orleans Nightmare
Money so old, it's growing white hair
Young Money, baby, yeah we right here
I'ma make sure we ball 'til we fall like tears
And mama, don't cry, your son can handle his
I got her out the hood and put her in the hills

Yeah, when I was 14, I told my mom we will see better days
And sure enough I got Miss Cita in a better place
When I was 14, I told my mom we will see better days
And sure enough, we did exactly what I say
I told my girl, ""When you fuck me, better fuck me good
'Cause if another girl could, she gon' fuck me good""
No sitting at the table if you bringing nothing to it
And I get straight to it like it's nothing to it
Yeah, I got game like Stuart Scott
Fresh out the ESPN shop
And when SportsCenter poppin', everything stoppin'
But you can't fool me, I know what you watching
Me! You watch me, you watch me, 'cause I be
Weezy, must see, TV, C3
Nigga that's me and I'm me, I'm me times three
So retreat or suffer defeat

Like not-not big in the sense of weight, you know what I mean?
Like gainin' weight or nothin' like that, like colossal
Like, know what I mean, like
I heard you were lookin' for me

Hey, Mr. Carter, Mr. Carter (hello)
Tell me, where have you been? Where have you been? (You know)
'Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (I know)

Tell me, where have you been? Where have you been? (Shit, you know)
'Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (hahaha)

Yeah, to you forever, from me to you
I heard somebody say ""Church"", I'ma need a suit
I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
I got the flow, I'm tryin' to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof, so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do? But I'ma leave it to
God, not Beaver, neither you
'Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O and even U
Man, I got Summer hatin' on me 'cause I'm hotter than the Sun
Got Spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than y'all
And I will never, I will never, I will never fall
I'm being hated by the seasons
So fuck y'all who hatin' for no reason

Hey, Mr. Carter, Mr. Carter (I am him)
Tell me, where have you been? Where have you been? (Around the world and I'm back again)

Yeah, I been in and out the bank, bitch
While y'all asshole niggas been on the same shit
I flush and watch 'em go down the drain quick
Two words you never hear ""Wayne quit""
'Cause Wayne win and they lose
I call them April babies, 'cause they fools
And when they snooze, we up
Feet up, like a parapleguc
Or paraplegic? I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing, old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream ""Su-Woo and ""Da-da-do""
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there
Long hair, don't even care (Young!)

Chea, I'm right here in my chair with my crown and my dear
Queen B, as I share mic time with my heir
Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielagos
So far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's being mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey, got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right, plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter) Young

It's my go, yeah
And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the Richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status-quo
Flow so pro
I know I ride slow, and when I pass they say
""What up, Killa?"" Man, stop bringin' up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie or Jay Z
Don't forget Weezy, baby

Hey, Mr. Carter, Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me, where have you been? Where have you been? (Yeah)
'Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (haha)

Hey, Mr. Carter, Mr. Carter
Tell me, where have you been? Where have you been? (I been hustlin')
'Cause they've been asking, they've been searching (hustlin' hard)
They've been wondering why (chyeah)
Hey, Mr. Carter, Mr. Carter

And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
It's gon' be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt
Fine, we'll lose two lives, yours and mine
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor, drippin' tears down my sleeve
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve"
2,lil wayne,a milli,"Young Money! You dig? Mack I'm going in

A millionaire
I'm a Young Money millionaire, tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil I leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
Cause I don't write shit cause I ain't got time
Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father, mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancing on the bridge, pussy popping
Tell the coppers ha-ha-ha-ha, you can't catch 'em, you can't stop 'em
I go by them goon rules, if you can't beat 'em then you pop 'em, you can't man 'em then you mop 'em, you can't stand 'em then you drop 'em
You pop 'em cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

Mothafucka, I'm ill

A million here a million there

Who that one that do that boy, you knew that, true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't O U like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushing flowers
Than to be in the pen sharing showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Mothafucka, I say life ain't shit without me
Chrome lips poking out the coupe, look like it's pouting
I do what I do and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain, dare me
Don't you compare me cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me, they don't feel me, but they fear me

Please don't me down cause I'm flyin' I'm high up
(This tea is at a real good temperature right now, so am I)

I spit Alcatraz bars I know
And d-boys is the only alphabet boys I know
Gotta 3-80 on my waist and Rambo at home
No more bandanna round my dome bandanna in my right pocket
B**** I'm grown f*** what you on
Now watch me stand on the world as I sit in a throne
And if I jump I'm a fly and look into the eagles eye
And see I am nothin' like you, why?
B**** see, it gets me how nothing gets me or get to me
And if you shootin' for the star than just shoot me
But your bullets don't reach mars
Pause, clause, because I'm a a beast I'm a dog ill get'cha

6,lil wayne,tie my hand,"We are at war
With the universe
The sky is falling
And the only thing that can save us now
Is sensitivity and compassion
But I know one thing's for sure
I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down

Yeah, some say tragedy is hard to get over
But some time that tragedy means its over, soldier
From the academy league of rollers
I deny being down though they seem to hold us
My shoulders are strong, I prove them wrong
I ain't doing nothing but moving on, let the truth be known
But they talk that freedom at us and didn't even leave a ladder, damn

I work at the corner store
We all got problems problems
No one's gon' fight alone
No one's gon' save us now
How you feel? you're not alone
We're all just jealous, jealous
We don't reach the sky no more
We just can't overcome no

You tie my hands
What am I gonna be
What have I done so bad
What is my destiny
You tie my hands
What am I supposed to see
What have I done so bad
What am I gonna be

I, knock on the door, hope isn't home
Fates not around, the lucks all gone
Don't ask me whats wrong, ask me whats right
And I'mma tell you what's life?
And did you know?
I lost everything, but I ain't the only one
First came the hurricane, then the morning sun
Excuse me if I'm on one, and don't trip if I light one, I walk a tight one
They try to tell me keep my eyes open
My whole city under water, some people still floating
And they wonder why black people still voting,
Cause your president's still choking
Take away the Football team, the Basketball team
Now all we got is me to represent New Orleans, shit
No governor, no help from the mayor
Just a steady beating heart, and a wish and a prayer
Lets pray

These friends they come and go
But I got family family
These kids so fast they grow
They learn so quickly now
But there's no where to go,
But there's future future
Don't make this seem so low
And we can't overcome

You tie my hands
What am I gonna be
What have I done so bad
What is my destiny
You tie my hands
What am I supposed to see
What have I done so bad
What am I gonna be

And if you come from under that water then there's fresh air
Just breathe baby, Gods got a blessing to spare
Yes, I know the process has so much stress
But its the progress that feels the best
Cause I came from the projects straight to success
And your next, so try they cant steal your pride its inside
Then find it and keep on grinding
Cause in every dark cloud there's a silver lining
I know...
Yeah, yeah... yeah
See... right now we just riding on love
And shine in the dark, we ain't tryna do nothing be at the heart
We need love, that's all now

You tie my hands
What am I gonna be
What have I done so bad
What is my destiny
You tie my hands
What am I supposed to see
What have I done so bad
What am I gonna be
You tie my hands
What am I gonna be
What have I done so bad
What is my destiny
You tie my hands
What am I supposed to see
What have I done so bad
What am I gonna be

Born right here in the USA
But due to tragedy, looked on by the whole world as a refugee
So, accept my emotion, do not take it as an offensive gesture
It's just the epitome of my soul
And I must be me
We got spirit y'all
We go spirit
We got soul y'all
We got soul
They don't want us to see, but we already know"

You see I handle mine, I dismantle mine
I told her tool box ""Bitch, it's Hammer-time""
So excuse me as I nail 'em to something

And I'll be gone, gone tonight

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)

I spend her love until she's broke inside

Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open, but it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning, I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

They don't know about the I-love-yous
But I bet you if they only knew (they don't know)
They would just be jealous of us

They don't know about the up-all-nights
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right (they don't know)
Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us

They don't know how special you are
They don't know what you've done to my heart
They can say anything they want
'Cause they don't know about us

They don't know what we do best
That's between me and you, our little secret
But I wanna tell 'em
I wanna tell the world that you're mine, girl

They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the I-love-yous (I love you)
But I bet you if they only knew (if they only knew)
They would just be jealous of us (they would just be jealous of us)

They don't know about the up-all-nights
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right (feels so right)
Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about

They don't know about the things we do (they don't know about us)
They don't know about the I-love-yous (they don't know about us)
But I bet you if they only knew (they don't know about us)
They would just be jealous of us

They don't know about the up-all-nights
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us

They don't know about us"

22,one direction,midnight memories,"One, two, three

Straight off the plane to a new hotel
Just touched down, you could never tell
Ah, a big house party with a crowded kitchen
People talk (shh) but we don't listen

Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Addison Lee
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, whoa

Midnight memories
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Baby, you and me
Stumblin' in the street
Singin', singin', singin', singin'
Midnight memories
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Anywhere we go, never say no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it

Five foot something with the skinny jeans
Don't look back, baby, follow me
I don't know where I'm going but I'm finding my way
Same old sh- but a different day

Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Addison Lee
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, whoa

Midnight memories
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Baby, you and me
Stumblin' in the street
Singin', singin', singin', singin'
Midnight memories
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Anywhere we go, never say no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it

You and me and all our friends
I don't care how much we spend
Baby, this is what the night is for
I know nothing's making sense
For tonight let's just pretend
I don't wanna stop so give me more

Midnight memories
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Baby, you and me (ayy)
Stumblin' in the street
Singin', singin', singin', singin'
Midnight memories
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Anywhere we go, never say no
Just do it, do it, (yeah) do it, do it"
23,one direction,night changes,"Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had she's showin' off
Drivin' too fast, moon is breakin' through her hair
She's headin' for somethin' that she won't forget
Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants

We're only gettin' older, baby
And I've been thinkin' about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you

Chasing it tonight, doubts are runnin' 'round her head
He's waitin', hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beatin' loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Movin' too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin
She's fallin', doesn't even know it yet
Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants

We're only gettin' older, baby
And I've been thinkin' about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you

Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missin' piece of innocence she lost

We're only gettin' older, baby
And I've been thinkin' about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby
It will never change, baby
It will never change me and you"
24,one direction,no control,"Oh, oh, oh
(Ooh, ooh)

Stained coffee cup
Just a fingerprint of lipstick's not enough
Sweet (ooh), where you lay (ooh)
Still a trace of innocence on the pillow case

Waking up
Beside you, I'm my loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control
No control
Powerless
And I don't care, it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed
No control

Oh, oh, oh
(Ooh)

The taste on my tongue
I don't want to wash away the night before
In the heat (ooh), where you laid (ooh)
I could stay right here and burn in it all day

Waking up
Beside you, I'm my loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control
No control
Powerless
And I don't care, it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed
No control

Lost my senses
I'm defenseless
Her perfume's holding me ransom
Sweet and sour
Heart devoured
Lying here, I count the hours

Waking up
Beside you, I'm my loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I got no control
No control
Powerless
And I don't care, it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed
No control
Oh, oh, oh
No control
Oh, oh, oh
No control

Powerless
And I don't care, it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed
No control"
